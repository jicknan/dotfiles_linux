# How does it work
#
# 1. first to create a file to record the last motified time, that is 
#    the program start time.
# 2. recourse the directory, and use find command get the modified file 
#    newer than the record file, if there's one, upload it with ncftpput.
# 3. if upload error was occurred, do not update the record file, and you
#    should run upload-script later time.

# Settins
#
# 1. Local settings
#    publish_dir is your emacs-wiki's publish dir, normal files under this 
#    dir will be checked. 
publish_dir=/home/jick/public_html

# file of recording the modified time, needless to change
ctf=$publish_dir/.ctime.txt

# 2. Serve settings
#    eg 1. If the remote publish dir is the one when you login, just
#	   as this blow.DON'T forget the last "." 
#	   FTP="-u user -p passwd -P port www.ftp.com  ." 
#    eg 2. Otherwise, likes me, but please remember  DOSEN'T need the
#	   last "/" 
ftp="-u jicknan -p <pass> ftp.sitesled.com ."

# travel the dir, and upload the modified files
travel()
{
     # get the relatid dir
    del=$(echo "$publish_dir" | wc -c)
    floor=$(echo "$PWD" | cut -c$del-)

     # upload the modified file newer than the $ctf
    echo "from $floor"
    for files in $(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -cnewer $ctf -print)
    do
	echo $files
	ncftpput $ftp/$floor $files
	if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then	# if upload failure...
	    return $?
	fi
    done

     # scan the folders, and enter it
    for dir in *; do
	if [ -d $dir ]; then
	    cd $dir
	    travel
	    cd ../
	fi
    done
}

# prepare work
if [ -e $ctf ]; then
    cd $publish_dir
    travel
    if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then
	echo "upload failure, transfer abort, you MUST upload them later time!"
    else
	echo "wikiupload created in $(date -R), records the modified time." > $ctf
    fi
else
    echo "First run this program, create the file for recoreding the motified time."
    echo "wikiupload created in $(date -R), records the modified time." > $ctf
fi
