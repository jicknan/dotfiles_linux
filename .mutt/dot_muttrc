# Note: This file doesn't contain any personal customization, i.e.,
# using it won't make you send messages with my name in the header.
#
# Things to change: You probably want to change the "priv.rc" source
# command in the end of this file.  Also, it's likely you want to have 
# a look at the the $editor and $tmpdir variables.
